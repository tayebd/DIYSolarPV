# DIYSolarPV
## DIY Solar PV project in Georgia


In this project we focus mainly on the counties that get their service from Georgia Power, the 4.2 million customers who are served by EMCs face less hurdles in setting up a solar PV array and connecting to the grid so the process should be simpler. The EMCs are generally more helpful to their customer/owners.  The proposed DIY system is around 5 Kw system with smart micro-inverters from EnPhase and solar panels from one of the best solar panel manufacturers, the balance of system components are provided as an estimate as they vary depending on the installation. The ROI (return on investment) of the system is more 20% and is further enhanced if the home or business owner can take advantage of the ITC tax credit. 

## DIY Solar PV Project Steps

The project proceed as follows:

* 1 - Design the system and obtain a permit from the county. This process varies from county to county. Most counties in Georgia do not have a process that’s specific to solar PV the only two exceptions are Dekalb (which leads the state in solar installations with three solarize campaigns so far) and the city of Atlanta. Dekalb’s process is nice and simple. The city of Atlanta’s process is slightly more complicated. With other countries the permit process for solar PV uses the permit process for a house addition, the requirements in this case will be a subset of what Dekalb would require so submitting the Dekalb forms will be more than enough. The Dekalb process is based on solar PV permitting best practices promoted by a national body. A permit might be necessary in the county, the solar PV system is not more costly or complicated that a re-roofing project of the installation of a new HVAC system. This system costs less $5000 with ITC credits and requires 22 attachment points on the roof. An average HVAC system costs $3815. Many homeowners will face the need to change aging HVAC system installed prior to 2010 with the phase out of R-22 refrigerant.  

* 2 - Obtaining financing. Many banks in the state are now familiar with financing solar projects after the Solarize campaigns in Tybee (68 participants in 2015), Savannah, Athens (701 participants), Dekalb/Decatur (850), Dunwoody (282), and the city of Atlanta (1085), and soon Roswell. The rates of the Solarize campaigns is relatively high compared to what is achievable by the DIY approach described here. Solarize Atlanta achieved a rate of $2.55/watt vs $0.95/watt after ITC for the DIY option. The ROI achievable by the Solarize Atlanta project is around 12% vs 23% for the DIY option.

* 3 - Acquire and install the solar panels and microinverters. Installing the system is a relatively straightforward installation. The panels will generally be installed on the roof but could also be ground mounted. In the case of roof mounted system the companies that sell roof mounting hardware provide tools to help determine the mounting locations where the owner needs to attach the flash mount that will support the mounting structure. In this approach we favor micro inverters from Enphase for many reasons:
With a micro inverter the installer has to deal only with AC (Alternating Current ) voltage, AC is easier to deal with that high voltage DC. The choice here is between micro-inverters and a string inverter like SolarEdge. In the case of a string inverter the output of the solar panels is combined on the roof and fed through a cable to a string inverter in the garage or on the side of the house. The electricity is fed as DC current with a voltage that could reach up a 600 volts (or 1000 or 15000 volts for commercial installations) depending on the number of panels in the string.  In the case of micro inverters, each panel is attached to a micro-inverter, the output of the micro-inverter is a 240 volts AC current similar to what is already available in the house for many appliances like HVAC units, washer/dryers and many woodworking tools.


The second reason to favor micro-inverters from Enphase is that enphase micro inverters are building blocks for a microgrid. This is particularly useful when dealing with utilities that are not Solar friendly like Georgia Power. The Enphase micro inverter can work as grid connected inverters and grid independent inverters at the same time. They can like many new inverters (e.g. SolarEdge) be connected to batteries. Enphase already sells a solar AC battery so one can use it to maximise self consumption, an HVAC system or a heat pump could also be considered analogous to a battery in the summer we can cool the house with the excess solar energy instead of sending it to the grid, if the house is well insulated the house can remain cool even after the sun sets. The solar panels can be installed to maximize solar production during periods of highest consumption, in some cases the best orientation could be facing West so that maximum solar production occurs in the evening during summer months where the AC units need to be turned on. In Georgia cooling accounts for the highest portion of electricity consumption. The same could be also accomplished for heating as has been done by many pioneers like Electrodacus ( https://electrodacus.com/ ) and the Ice Energy company ( https://www.ice-energy.com/ ). The average family spends around 2000 on energy /year and 1600 on electricity. 30% of the energy is used for space heating and 11% for air conditioning. In another note we will discuss the ROi for installing a heat pump.

## Is selling excess electricity to the Georgia Power grid worthwhile?

Georgia Power buys excess production at less than 4.4 cents/KwH (avoided cost which can decrease in future years) and sells it at 15 cents /KwH, even if the published rate is lower. The higher cost is due to all the extra charges GP adds to the cost of electricity like Environmental compliance, Nuclear Construction, Municipal Franchise fee, sales tax. 

Although Georgia Power has several buyback programs, right now the only one that is currently open is the RNR tariff Program.  Under this program, a customer uses the solar-produced energy for the building use.  At any given moment, if the solar production is greater than what the building needs, then the excess electricity flows back on Georgia Power lines. The customer will receive credits on their next bill for that excess power.  If the homeowner chooses to participate in the RNR program, the monthly charge is an additional $7.32 per month and Georgia Power will pay avoided cost for the energy put back on the grid. Avoided cost for 2018 is 4.4¢ per kWh (according to Energy Save). This cost per kWh changes annually, and historically has decreased over the past several years. This means the solar PV system would have to generate 166 kWh (2.82+4.50/4.4¢) every month in excess (over the amount the building consumes) in order to recover the costs from the metering charges.

The homeowner can choose not to enroll in the RNR Program and simply offset the home’s energy usage, and save that way. Self-generation and offsetting energy will avoid energy purchased from Georgia Power and will reduce electricity bills. The homeowner may use solar to offset onsite energy consumption without participating in any Georgia Power program, but still needs to notify Georgia Power of the installation to program the Smart Meter accordingly to prevent back feed and unsafe working conditions for Georgia Power employees.

In the proposed system produces 5.18 KwH / day, 155.4 KwH/ month so it’s not worth it to connect to Georgia Power. 

## Georgia Power Charges

Interconnection Testing: Georgia Power will test the performance and safety of the energy resource prior to operation. The cost of testing is $5/kW.

Metering: The Company will install single-directional metering or bi-directional metering depending on the provider’s method of installation.  

The provider will enter into a contract with the Company to cover all incremental metering (e.g. poly-phase meters, trans-sockets, dual-gang sockets, etc.) and interconnection costs. Additionally, provider agrees to pay a monthly metering cost as outlined below.
Single-phase Single-directional metering charge: $ 4.50 per month
Poly-phase Single-directional metering charge: $11.20 per month  
Bi-directional metering charge: $ 2.82 per month

The additional charges imposed by Georgia Power make the option of installing batteries more appealing. The Enphase system can be set-up to not export any production to the grid so all the production can be used for self consumption. In this case the cooling system, the heating system and the AC battery could be used to store the excess energy produced during the day. The homeowner will avoid the $7 to $16/month charges imposed by Georgia Power in addition to the delays, and the testing charges ($5/Kw not really significant). LG Chem sells a 9.8 KwH battery for $7000, Tesla sells only 2 Powerwalls at a cost of $14500 for 36 KwH that’s more than is required and would not provide a positive ROI. EnPhase provides batteries in 1 KwH increments at a cost of $1500. The batteries are eligible for the ITC. One Enphase battery produces return of investment of 13.58%, with two batteries the ROI is 9.40%. For users seeking larger systems an interesting option will be to install smart HVAC system that store energy as ICE, Ice Energy sells a AC system that can store the energy as ICE and then use later in the day to cool the house.
